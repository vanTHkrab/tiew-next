# Contributor Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a contributor listing page that reads from the `contribute/` directory using Next.js server actions.

## Features
- **Server Action**: Uses `'use server'` directive to read files from the filesystem
- **File Reading**: Reads all `.md` files from the `contribute/` directory
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles files that can't be read
- **Sorting**: Contributors are sorted alphabetically by name
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, card-based design with hover effects

## Technical Implementation

### Server Action
```typescript
async function getContributors(): Promise<Contributor[]>
```
- Uses `fs/promises` for async file operations
- Filters for `.md` files only
- Extracts contributor name from filename
- Reads file content for display
- Handles errors gracefully

### TypeScript Interface
```typescript
interface Contributor {
  name: string;
  filename: string;
  content?: string;
}
```

### UI Components
- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Card-based design with hover effects
- Avatar circles with initials
- Content display with line clamping
- Loading and empty states

## File Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   └── contibutor/
│       └── page.tsx          # Contributor listing page
├── types/
│   └── contributor.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
└── .ai/
    └── contributor-feature.md # This documentation
```

## Usage
Navigate to `/contibutor` to view the contributor listing page. The page will automatically read all `.md` files from the `contribute/` directory and display them in a responsive grid layout.

## Future Enhancements
- Add pagination for large contributor lists
- Implement search/filter functionality
- Add contributor profile pages
- Support for contributor avatars
- Add contribution date tracking
